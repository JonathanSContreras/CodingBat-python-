# NOT SOLVED YET


# We want to make a row of bricks that is goal inches long. 
# We have a number of small bricks (1 inch each) and big bricks (5 inches each). 
# Return True if it is possible to make the goal by choosing from the given bricks. 
# This is a little harder than it looks and can be done without any loops.
